Earlier in November the project cost was assessed at $22 to $35 billion, not including a $3.5 billion gas pipeline to carry gas from inland British Columbia to the future liquefaction plant.

Average forward prices in Boston this winter are expected to be $13.70/MMBtu which is lower than the last winter, but much higher in comparison with previous winters. This is notably due to the lack of additional capacity to ship more gas from Marcellus gas field to Boston. Moreover, production from eastern Canada's liquefaction terminals is not high enough to meet the New England's peak demand. Concerning New York City, the forward prices for winter 2014-2015 are still higher than the spot prices for the 2012-2013 winter (the 2013-2014 winter was unusually cold), though several pipe expansions were developed to carry more gas from Marcellus to New York City.</p><p><span class="wat-rteStyle-IntenseEmphasis">IEA, 11/25/2014</span></p></div><div id="j-tab-2"><h3 class="wat-rteElement-Heading3">LNG Terminal</h3><h4 class="wat-rteElement-Heading4">Queensland Curtis LNG&#58; first cargo by year-end</h4><p>The first shipment from BG's Queensland Curtis LNG is expected to be exported by year-end, on schedule. According to local newspaper the precise date could be December 20, but BG Group did not confirm. Queesland Curtis would be the world's first coalseam gas-to-LNG plant to start production.

The reason lies in the Indonesian government's refusals of selling spot cargoes. Bontang was therefore forced to cancel several cargoes due to lack of government approval. Cargo cancellations and the lack of clarity of the government's policy lead buyers to find elsewhere more reliable supplies.</p><p><span class="wat-rteStyle-IntenseEmphasis">Platts LNG Daily, 11/19/2014</span></p><h4 class="wat-rteElement-Heading4">Kogas plans to decrease LNG imports</h4><p>State-run Kogas would buy fewer LNG cargoes for its near future consumption, due to the slow down of economy, the restart of nuclear reactors, higher coal demand and mild temperatures. Between January and October 2014, Kogas sold the LNG equivalent of 27.6 Mt of gas, down 9.6% year-onyear. The country's LNG demand is expected to increase to 42.14 Mt, up 2.6% in 2015, before decreasing by 0.5% to 41.95 Mt in 2016, by 2.9% to 40.74 Mt in 2017 and down another 2.3% to 39.81 Mt in 2018.</p><p><span class="wat-rteStyle-IntenseEmphasis">Platts LNG Daily, 11/20/2014</span></p><h4 class="wat-rteElement-Heading4">Chubu plans to introduce JKM indexation in term contracts</h4><p>Japan's Chubu aims to increase JKM indexation in its LNG deals as part of its future LNG term contracts in order to mitigate costs.

It represents a switch from the previous strategy which relied on acquiring only minority stake. This change was triggered by the very low domestic coal reserves hindering coal power generation in India. Coal India, the largest coal mining company in the world, failed to increase its production in consistency with the demand. Coal imports increased by 11% to 152 Mt in 2014 in comparison with 2013.</p><p><span class="wat-rteStyle-IntenseEmphasis">Enerdata, 11/20/2014</span></p><h3 class="wat-rteElement-Heading3">Gas Transport &amp; Storage</h3><h4 class="wat-rteElement-Heading4">India eyes Turkmeni gas</h4><p>India eyes to import gas from Turkmenistan and seeks assistance from Turkmenistan to tackle the remaining issues for smooth commissioning of TAPI gas pipeline project.

Cyprus is also all in favour of such a project despite difficulties which need to be overcome with Turkey. The proposed pipeline could turn the Eastern Mediterranean into a natural gas hub which would contribute in European objectives of supply diversification.

According to a study performed by Cedigaz, supplies from Africa to Europe dropped to 31.5 Bcm whereas Europe's gas import increased to 200 Bcm. This fall is due to political instability and a growing domestic demand. Moreover, experts do not consider imports from Israel as a realistic option, as the later seems to favor exports to neighboring countries and lacks its own export terminal. Moreover Cyprus' proven resources are not high enough yet to the start the construction of a profitable LNG facility. </p><p><span class="wat-rteStyle-IntenseEmphasis">ESGM, 11/25/2014</span></p></div><div id="j-tab-4"><h3 class="wat-rteElement-Heading3">Gas Transport &amp; Storage</h3><h4 class="wat-rteElement-Heading4">Europe&#58; gas imports from Africa decrease</h4><p>According to a Cedigaz's study the share of gas from Africa in the European mix decreased by 20% year-on-year and could continue to drop. This trend is notably due to political instability which has hit African production since a couple of years. Moreover, another reason highlighted by the study is the increasing part of African production used for domestic needs. A sharp fall of Algerian gas imports weights on this downward trend, as the exports were down 21% to 25.8 Bcm in 2013. Libya's exports to Europe also declined by 12% to 5.7 Bcm in 2013. Nigeria follows the same trend with a drop of 5.3% of its exports to Europe. According to the study, Europe increased its Russian gas imports to offset the fall of supplies from Africa.</p><p><span class="wat-rteStyle-IntenseEmphasis">ESGM, 11/24/2014</span></p></div><div id="j-tab-5"><h3 class="wat-rteElement-Heading3">LNG Terminal</h3><h4 class="wat-rteElement-Heading4">Caribbean LNG's FLNG expected to be anchored in Colombia by June</h4><p>Caribbean LNG's FLNG is believed to arrive by June at a location offshore Colombia's Caribbean Coast.

Selon les estimations de l’opérateur, Yamal LNG représente un investissement total de 27 milliards de dollars. </p><p align="left">« <em>Avec le lancement de Yamal LNG, Total renforce son portefeuille de projets qui soutiendront sa production au-delà de 2017 pour les décennies à venir et accroît sa présence en Russie, dans une région à fort potentiel en ressources gazières</em> », commente Yves-Louis Darricarrère, Président Upstream de Total. « <em>Yamal LNG a enregistré des progrès considérables ces derniers mois et Total, en partenariat avec Novatek, continuera à mobiliser ses compétences afin de démarrer ce projet GNL de premier ordre dans les temps</em> ». </p><p align="left">Le projet, opéré par la société Yamal LNG JSC, porte sur le développement du gigantesque gisement onshore de gaz et de condensats de Tambey Sud, situé sur la péninsule de Yamal. Le projet comprendra trois trains de liquéfaction de 5,5 Mt/a chacun, dont les démarrages successifs sont prévus en 2017, 2018 et 2019, des infrastructures de stockage de GNL et des installations portuaires à Sabetta. La construction des infrastructures (aéroport, port, quartier de vie) a bien progressé, le chantier mobilisant déjà plus de 3 000 personnes sur place. Seize méthaniers brise-glaces assureront le transport du GNL vers les marchés internationaux. </p><p align="left">Environ 70 % de la production de GNL du projet Yamal LNG a déjà été vendue dans le cadre de contrats à long terme indexés sur le cours du pétrole, principalement à destination de l’Asie, et le solde en Europe. </p><p align="left">Yamal LNG est aujourd’hui détenu par Novatek (80 %) et Total (20 %). En septembre 2013, Novatek et China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) ont conclu un accord pour l’entrée attendue de CNPC à hauteur de 20 % dans le projet. </p><p align="left"><strong>Total Exploration-Production en Russie<br></strong>Présent en Russie depuis 1991, Total y a produit 179 000 barils équivalents pétrole par jour (bep/j) en 2012. Cette production provient du champ onshore de Kharyaga (détenu à 40 % et opéré par Total) ainsi que d’autres champs, via la participation du Groupe dans Novatek qui produit plus de 10 % du gaz russe. </p><p align="left">En dehors de Yamal LNG, Total (49 %) et Novatek (51 %) développent également le champ onshore de gaz et de condensats de Termokarstovoye (d’une capacité de 65 000 bep/j), situé dans la province de Yamalo-Nenets et dont la production devrait démarrer en 2015.</p><p align="left"><strong>Total, un leader mondial du GNL<br></strong>Leader mondial du gaz naturel liquéfié, Total s’appuie sur des positions solides et diversifiées sur l’ensemble de la chaîne de valeur du GNL. Le Groupe est présent dans la plupart des grandes régions productrices de GNL ainsi que sur les principaux marchés consommateurs de GNL et se développe fortement sur cette activité clé de sa stratégie de croissance. </p><p align="left">Total participe à des projets GNL en Indonésie, au Qatar, aux Émirats Arabes Unis, à Oman, au Nigeria, en Norvège, au Yémen, en Angola et en Australie. Le Groupe a signé des contrats d’achat de GNL à partir du terminal gazier de Sabine Pass aux États-Unis et dispose de capacités de long terme de regazéification sur les principaux marchés du GNL. </p><p align="left">Présent dans le trading, le marketing et la logistique, Total peut ainsi apporter sa production de gaz naturel et de GNL directement à ses clients partout dans le monde, tout en ayant la possibilité de saisir les opportunités de marché. </p><p align="left"><strong>Total dans l’Arctique, une position responsable<br></strong>Conscient des défis spécifiques que représentent l’exploration et la production dans l’Arctique, Total y applique des normes de sécurité et environnementales encore plus strictes qu’ailleurs, en prenant le plus grand soin de sauvegarder les écosystèmes particulièrement fragiles. </p><p align="left">Pour la valorisation des hydrocarbures dans cette région, Total a décidé de donner la priorité à des projets gaziers plutôt que pétroliers. Les cinq projets de Total dans l’Arctique se situent tous en dehors des zones de banquise polaire. Parmi ses cinq projets, quatre sont des projets gaziers &#58; Snøhvit et Norvarg en Norvège ; Yamal LNG et Termokarstovoye en Russie. Le seul projet pétrolier concerne le gisement de Kharyaga en Russie, qui est onshore. Le Groupe n’a pas l’intention d’exploiter des champs pétroliers offshore sous la banquise. </p><p align="left">L’Arctique étant appelé à jouer un rôle majeur dans la croissance future du secteur GNL, Total entend mettre à profit son expertise et son expérience technique dans ce domaine, en particulier à travers son programme de R&amp;D Grand Froid qui couvre la santé et la sécurité, le GNL arctique, l’ingénierie arctique, les technologies arctiques, la gestion de projet et les ressources humaines ainsi que l’environnement. </p><p align="left"><strong>Retrouver plus d’informations et des vidéos du projet Yamal LNG sur</strong> &#58; <a href="http&#58;//total.com/fr/energies-savoir-faire/petrole-gaz/exploration-production/projets-realisations/gnl/yamal-lng"><span style="text-decoration&#58;underline;"><font color="#0066cc">http&#58;//total.com/fr/energies-savoir-faire/petrole-gaz/exploration-production/projets-realisations/gnl/yamal-lng</font></span></a><em><font size="1"></font></em></p><em><font size="1"></font></em><em><font size="1"></font></em><em><font size="1"></font></em><p>​</p>]]></WAT:publishingpagecontent><WAT:socialfeature>False</WAT:socialfeature><WAT:source /><WAT:theme /><WAT:userprop /><WAT:username /><WAT:entity /><WAT:nomination /><WAT:upfront>True</WAT:upfront><WAT:global /><WAT:nominationdate /><WAT:keywords /><WAT:publishingrollupimage2>#</WAT:publishingrollupimage2></item><item><title>Journée internationale de lutte contre la corruption</title><link>http://wat.corp.local/sites/s106/fr-FR/Pages/2012-2013 Contenus Migrés/0912---Journée-internationale-de-lutte-contre-la-corruption.aspx</link><description>A cette occasion, Sylvie Rapin, Bertrand Bakkaus et Patrick Millot exposent les actions mises en place ces 6 derniers mois en matière d’Intégrité </description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2013 05:43:00 +01:00</pubDate><author>Laurent SAUVAGE</author><WAT:subtitle>Intégrité : Entretien avec Sylvie Rapin, Bertrand Bakkaus et Patrick Millot</WAT:subtitle><WAT:originalnewspaperlink /><WAT:publishingexpirationdate /><WAT:upfront>False</WAT:upfront><WAT:publishingrollupimage>http://wat-content.corp.local/_layouts/15/total/wat/GetFileHandler.ashx?fileurl=http%3a%2f%2fwat.corp.local%2fsites%2fs106%2ffr-FR%2fPublishingImages%2fPages%2f0912---Journ%c3%a9e-internationale-de-lutte-contre-la-corruption%2fjmcorruption.png</WAT:publishingrollupimage><WAT:publishingpagecontent><![CDATA[<p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph">Aujourd’hui, à l’occasion de la Journée internationale de lutte contre la corruption (ONU), Sylvie Rapin, Responsable Conformité Branche pour l’EP et pour G&amp;P, Bertrand Bakkaus, Coordinateur anti-fraude pour la branche EP et Patrick Millot, Coordinateur anti-fraude pour Gas &amp; Power, exposent les actions mises en place ces 6 derniers mois en matière d’Intégrité.</p><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph"><br></p><h3 class="wat-rteElement-Heading3">Nous nous sommes vus il y a 6 mois … Quelles étaient alors vos priorités ?</h3><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph"><strong>​Sylvie Rapin &#58;</strong>« Nous voulions ensemble construire un vrai projet « intégrité », cohérent et le plus complet possible, afin de rendre plus lisibles les notions d’anti-corruption, d’anti-fraude, d’anti-trust et d’éthique pour tous nos collègues. »</p><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph"><strong>Bertrand Bakkaus </strong>&#58;« Dans cet esprit, nous avons choisi « Intégrité » comme nom pour le séminaire international EP et G&amp;P qui s’est déroulé en octobre dernier. Parce que, si l’on revient à la définition du mot, une personne intègre est une personne honnête et incorruptible. Je pense que c’est une définition qui regroupe &#160;toutes ces notions. »</p><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph"><br></p><h3 class="wat-rteElement-Heading3">​Quel était l’objectif de ce séminaire ?</h3><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph"><strong>Patrick Millot &#58;</strong>« Le séminaire nous a permis de rassembler, pour la première fois, les équipes d’Exploration-Production et de Gas &amp; Power travaillant sur le sujet de l’Intégrité.

Le titre donné à notre séminaire était d’ailleurs « Upholding our Integrity » &#160;- « Affirmer notre intégrité ». La « tolérance &#160;zéro » concernant la fraude, la corruption et la concurrence, ainsi que le développement de cette culture Intégrité commune ont été rappelés de manière forte, lors du séminaire, par Yves-Louis Darricarrère, directeur général Upstream, et Philippe Sauquet, directeur Gas &amp; Power. »</p><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph"><br></p><h3 class="wat-rteElement-Heading3">Sur quelles idées-forces ce séminaire &#160;a-t-il débouché ?</h3><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph"><strong>PM &#58;</strong>« D’abord – et cela a été souligné par l’ensemble des participants - la nécessité de mettre à disposition de tous des outils pour assurer le déploiement de la démarche Intégrité à l’EP et G&amp;P.

Sur ce site Intranet, nos collègues trouveront les documents de référence qui fondent les programmes d’intégrité au sein du Groupe et la liste des correspondants Intégrité. Lutter contre la corruption est du ressort de chacun d’entre nous &#58; si quelqu’un est confronté à une situation qui l’interpelle, il faut qu’il sache comment y faire face et à qui s’adresser pour en parler. »</p><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph"><strong>SR &#58;</strong>« Très symboliquement, nous avons tenu à ouvrir ce site à nos collègues aujourd’hui 9 décembre, parce que c’est la date choisie par l’ONU pour la Journée internationale de lutte contre la corruption.

Il permet à ceux qui sont susceptibles d’être confrontés aux risques d’abus de positions dominantes, ou d’ententes, d’avoir les clés pour adopter un comportement approprié en toutes circonstances. Nous avons travaillé à partir d’une analyse de risques pour cibler les personnes qui vont suivre cette formation. Notre objectif est d’atteindre le même niveau de réussite que pour la formation anti-corruption. »</p><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph"><br></p><h3 class="wat-rteElement-Heading3">Avez-vous un message à faire passer aux collaborateurs EP et G&amp;P ?</h3><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph"><strong>PM &#58;</strong>« Nous en avons plusieurs.

Nous continuons à évoluer et à adapter notre activité pour répondre aux besoins de nos clients, des salariés et bien sûr du groupe Total, notre actionnaire ! Cette newsletter permettra à chacun d’être informé de l’actualité des entités de la direction Marketing.</div><div>&#160;</div><div>La coopération permanente entre les différentes entités est ce que j’apprécie le plus dans notre organisation. Les Centres d’Expertise et les différents Comités paneuropéens sont des exemples concrets de cette coopération, visant à &#160;partager nos « best practices » et nos expériences. Ces instances semblent bien fonctionner et produisent déjà des procédures, des reportings et des projets communs. Les échanges, le support et la coopération entre entités fonctionnent également très bien de manière informelle et c’est réellement très satisfaisant. Je suis convaincu qu’il existe dans nos équipes le sentiment d’une mission commune.</div><div>&#160;</div><div>En 2012, nous avons réalisé une excellente performance financière malgré des conditions de marché difficiles. Notre performance &#160;depuis le début de l’année 2013 est bien au-dessus du budget grâce aux bons résultats des entités en France et au Royaume-Uni (voir nos résultats ci-dessous).</div><div>2013 est une année très importante. Nos activités plus matures doivent réaliser une très bonne performance économique pour permettre à nos entités en Belgique et aux Pays-Bas de se développer, et pour faire croître notre activité en Allemagne. Nous avons fait un bon début d’année et nous devons maintenir un fort dynamisme commercial pour nous assurer de bons résultats sur le reste de l’année.</div><div>&#160;</div><div>Nous avons également comme objectif pour 2013, et au-delà, de rester vigilants quant à notre maîtrise HSE. La branche Gas &amp; Power enregistre de mauvaises performances en ce début d’année dans ce domaine prioritaire. Nous devons tous prendre nos responsabilités et faire le maximum pour réduire les risques, que ce soit dans nos bureaux au Royaume-Uni, sur la route en Allemagne ou sur un terminal de charbon en France. Il n’y a pas de place à la complaisance.</div><div>&#160;​</div><div>J’ai la conviction que la Direction Marketing Gas &amp; Power représente une belle opportunité de créer de la valeur pour le Groupe et pour toutes les personnes qui participent au développement de ce nouveau business. J’espère que vous apprécierez notre newsletter. Je vous donne rendez-vous dans les prochains numéros pour vous informer de notre progression.</div><div>&#160;</div><div><img alt="john_shead.jpg" src="http://wat-content.corp.local/_layouts/15/total/wat/GetFileHandler.ashx?fileurl=http%3a%2f%2fwat.corp.local%2fsites%2fs106%2ffr-FR%2fPublishingImages%2fPages%2fPremi%c3%a8re-newsletter-des-filiales-marketing-de-Gas--Power%2fjohn_shead.jpg" style="margin&#58;5px;" /><br></div><div><strong>J</strong><strong>ohn Shead, Directeur Marketing, Gas &amp; Powe</strong><strong>r</strong></div>]]></WAT:publishingpagecontent><WAT:socialfeature>False</WAT:socialfeature><WAT:source /><WAT:theme /><WAT:userprop /><WAT:username /><WAT:entity /><WAT:nomination /><WAT:upfront>False</WAT:upfront><WAT:global /><WAT:nominationdate /><WAT:keywords>g＆p marketing;newsletter</WAT:keywords><WAT:publishingrollupimage2>#</WAT:publishingrollupimage2></item><item><title>17e congrès international sur le gaz naturel liquéfié LNG17</title><link>http://wat.corp.local/sites/s106/fr-FR/Pages/2012-2013 Contenus Migrés/17e-congrès-international-sur-le-gaz-naturel-liquéfié-LNG17.aspx</link><description>LNG 17 est l’événement de l’année 2013 en terme de gaz : plus de  5000 décisionnaires de l’industrie du gaz, venant de 80 pays s'étaient réunis à Houston pour aborder les tendances, défis et opportunités que représentent l’industrie du GNL aujourd’hui.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2013 12:13:00 +02:00</pubDate><author>Laurent SAUVAGE</author><WAT:subtitle>Total, sponsor Platinium, était présent sur un stand de 200m² </WAT:subtitle><WAT:originalnewspaperlink /><WAT:publishingexpirationdate /><WAT:upfront>False</WAT:upfront><WAT:publishingrollupimage>http://wat-content.corp.local/_layouts/15/total/wat/GetFileHandler.ashx?fileurl=http%3a%2f%2fwat.corp.local%2fsites%2fs106%2ffr-FR%2fPublishingImages%2fPages%2f17e-congr%c3%a8s-international-sur-le-gaz-naturel-liqu%c3%a9fi%c3%a9-LNG17%2flng.png</WAT:publishingrollupimage><WAT:publishingpagecontent><![CDATA[<div>​​LNG 17 est l’événement de l’année 2013 en terme de gaz &#58; plus de &#160;5000 décisionnaires de l’industrie du gaz, venant de 80 pays s'étaient réunis à Houston pour aborder les tendances, défis et opportunités que représentent l’industrie du GNL aujourd’hui.</div><div><br></div><div>Total, sponsor Platinium, était présent sur un stand de 200m² dans lequel se sont succédés quelques 50 participants, délégués et exposants venus de Houston, du Siège mais aussi du Japon et du Nigeria.</div><div><br></div><div>En termes d’interventions, Total a fait deux présentations respectivement sur le GNL comme fuel de transport et sur le FLNG à petite échelle &#160;ainsi que l’animation de la session sur les &quot; New Markets , New Projects &quot; &#160;en ouverture le 1er jour du congrès.</div><div><br></div><div>Par ailleurs, le stand a reçu la visite de personnalités de l’UGI (Union du Gaz Naturel), de GTI (Gaz Technology Institute) et de l’AGA (American Gas Association) ; <strong>Laurent Maurel</strong>, directeur Stratégie, Marchés &amp; GNL, <strong>Daniel Laure</strong>, directeur Actifs Industriels, Finance, Informatique et <strong>Bruce Henderson</strong>, Président de TGPNA étaient présents pour les accueillir.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>Traditionnellement, les sociétés organisent des soirées privées.

Cet accord s’ajoute à celui que le Groupe avait déjà signé en septembre avec Kogas pour l’achat de 0,7 million de tonnes de GNL par an à partir de ce même terminal et fait de Total l’une des premières Majors à se positionner sur l’exportation de gaz américain.</p><h2 class="wat-rteElement-Heading2">&#160;<img class="wat-rteImage-2 wat-rtePosition-4" alt="laurent_vivier_2.jpg" src="http://wat-content.corp.local/_layouts/15/total/wat/GetFileHandler.ashx?fileurl=http%3a%2f%2fwat.corp.local%2fsites%2fs106%2ffr-FR%2fPublishingImages%2fPages%2f2012-2013%2520Contenus%2520Migr%c3%a9s%2f2203-revolution-du-gaz-de-schiste%2flaurent_vivier_2.jpg" style="margin&#58;5px;" />&#160;&#160;&#160;Laurent Vivier&#160;&#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; Jean-Pierre Mateille&#160;&#160; <img class="wat-rteImage-2 wat-rtePosition-4" alt="jp_mateille_2.jpg" src="http://wat-content.corp.local/_layouts/15/total/wat/GetFileHandler.ashx?fileurl=http%3a%2f%2fwat.corp.local%2fsites%2fs106%2ffr-FR%2fPublishingImages%2fPages%2f2012-2013%2520Contenus%2520Migr%c3%a9s%2f2203-revolution-du-gaz-de-schiste%2fjp_mateille_2.jpg" style="margin&#58;5px;" />&#160;</h2><h3 class="wat-rteElement-Heading3">La révolution du gaz de schiste place désormais les Etats-Unis en situation d’exportateurs de gaz. Total avait-il anticipé cette évolution et ses conséquences sur le marché mondial du gaz ?</h3><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph">Jean-Pierre Mateille - Avec l’essor des gaz non conventionnels, le schéma initial s’est en effet inversé &#58; jusqu’à présent importateurs de gaz, les Etats-Unis sont aujourd’hui en position d’en exporter. C’est un bouleversement majeur pour l’économie mondiale que Total, comme toutes les Majors d’ailleurs, n’avait pas prévu. Au contraire, face au déclin de leur production de gaz conventionnels, nous pensions tous que les Etats-Unis auraient besoin d’importer davantage.</p><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph">Laurent Vivier - C’est d’ailleurs la raison pour laquelle Total avait dès 2009 réservé une capacité de regazéification dans le terminal de Sabine Pass. Cette capacité de 10Gm3/an – soit près de la moitié des capacités de regazéification du Groupe ! – devait nous préparer à la dépendance croissante des Etats-Unis vis-à-vis du GNL. Mais le développement spectaculaire du gaz de schiste sur le sol américain a eu tôt fait de remettre en cause ce scénario…&#160;</p><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph">&#160;</p><h3 class="wat-rteElement-Heading3">Autrement dit, Total a investi dans une capacité de regazéification désormais dénuée d’utilité ? Comment remédier à cette situation ?</h3><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph">Jean-Pierre Mateille – Total a su s’adapter. Nous avions certes une capacité qui n’était plus utilisée, mais nous l’avons mise à profit pour nous positionner sur la reconversion du terminal de Sabine Pass en site de liquéfaction. Les deux accords que nous avons signés en 2012 pour l’achat de GNL nous permettent d’éviter les pertes liées à notre capacité de regazéification. Surtout, ils nous placent parmi les leaders d’un marché naissant et pour l’instant très fermé &#58; nul ne sait quel volume de GNL les Etats-Unis exporteront à terme.</p><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph">Laurent Vivier – Ces accords sont en effet la démonstration de la réactivité et de la flexibilité de Total. Parce que le Groupe est un acteur intégré sur l’ensemble de la chaîne gazière, présent dans la plupart des régions productrices de gaz comme sur les principaux marchés consommateurs de GNL, nous avons été capables d’inverser très vite notre positionnement sur le marché du gaz américain, en passant de l’importation à l’exportation. Nous avions les moyens de faire face à l’imprévu, ce qui est finalement, autant que de prédire avec certitude les évolutions du marché mondial, un enjeu essentiel pour Total.</p><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph">&#160;</p><h3 class="wat-rteElement-Heading3">Les perspectives offertes par ces nouvelles positions sont-elles prometteuses ?</h3><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph">Jean-Pierre Mateille - Nous n’aurions naturellement pas pris la décision d’acheter du GNL américain si nous ne la pensions pas bénéfique pour le Groupe. Nous tablons notamment sur le différentiel de prix entre les marchés américain et asiatique &#58; il est aujourd'hui de 6 à 7$ par mmbtu * voire plus dans le cas du Japon! Dans ces conditions, vendre en Asie du gaz acheté aux Etats-Unis est une opération très rentable.</p><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph">A moins que l’Asie ne connaisse sa propre révolution du gaz de schiste, cet écart devrait perdurer &#58; la demande des pays asiatiques ne cesse de croître alors que les coûts engendrés par leur éloignement des zones de production demeurent importants. Nous n’oublions pas non plus l’Europe, dont les besoins d’approvisionnement en gaz pourraient être revus à la hausse d’ici quelques années, à la faveur d’une reprise de l’activité.</p><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph">*le $/mmbtu est une unité utilisée pour le prix du gaz. A titre indicatif,&#160; le prix du gaz aux Etats Unis s'établit entre 3 et 4$/mmbtu, en Europe autour de 10$ et en Asie entre 15 et 18$.</p><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph">&#160;</p><h3 class="wat-rteElement-Heading3">D’un engagement financier à perte hier, Total signerait donc aujourd’hui une réussite financière avec Sabine Pass ?</h3><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph">Laurent Vivier - Rappelons tout de même que cette prise de position, certes validée par nos prévisions, constitue d’abord un engagement financier important de la part de Total. Nous évitons des pertes, mais nous réalisons aussi un investissement. Cela mérite d’être souligné car cette capacité à s’engager contribue à la crédibilité du Groupe sur le marché mondial de GNL.<br>&#160;<br>En effet, notre décision d’acheter du gaz américain destiné à l’export a des conséquences qui vont au-delà de l’opération financière. Elle entérine notamment l’entrée massive de Total G&amp;P dans le transport de GNL &#58; nous serons bientôt à la tête d’une flotte de 6 à 8 méthaniers alors que le Groupe ne détient aujourd’hui que deux chartes long terme par l’intermédiaire de la filiale EP en Norvège. Elle dénote aussi une évolution de notre stratégie puisque pour la première fois nous investissons dans un projet déconnecté de réserves, à vocation uniquement commerciale. </p><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph">&#160;</p><h3 class="wat-rteElement-Heading3">L’exemple de Sabine Pass servirait-il ainsi à la redéfinition de la stratégie du Groupe sur le marché mondial du gaz ?</h3><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph">Jean-Pierre Mateille - Sabine Pass constitue assurément une opération inédite pour Total. Elle tient compte de l’évolution du marché &#58; sur un marché en croissance, où les incertitudes sont fortes, où les contrats court-terme (contrats spot) gagnent du terrain, Total doit acquérir de la flexibilité. C’est ce que nous avons fait avec Sabine Pass. Pour autant, l’achat de gaz américain reste au service d’un positionnement plus large et plus intégré.</p><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph">Laurent Vivier - En effet, notre prise de position à Sabine Pass ne remet pas en cause les grands principes de notre stratégie. Notre priorité demeure le développement de projets dits classiques, qui ont pour objectif la valorisation de nos réserves. Je pense en particulier aux grands projets en cours comme Yamal, Gladstone, Ichthys, Angola ou Brass LNG &#58; ce sont eux qui permettront de répondre à l’augmentation de la demande de GNL – estimée à plus de 4% par an d’ici 2030 ! – tout en garantissant la sécurité de l’approvisionnement via des contrats long terme.</p><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph">&#160;</p><h3 class="wat-rteElement-Heading3">Précisément, dans quelle mesure l’opération de Sabine Pass peut-elle servir ces grands projets ?</h3><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph">Jean-Pierre Mateille -&#160; Elle les sert parce qu’elle renforce le leadership de Total sur l’ensemble de la chaîne gazière. En aucun cas cette décision n’a été dissociée de la stratégie de l’amont, c’est-à-dire de l’Exploration-Production. A l’échelle des Etats-Unis d’abord, on remarque que la quantité réservée par Total à la sortie du terminal de Sabine Pass, soit 2,7Mt/an, correspond plus ou moins à notre production dans les Barnett Shale et l’Utica Shale, où Total a signé un accord avec l’américain Chesapeake*. A l’échelle mondiale ensuite, elle permet de diversifier et de fiabiliser notre portefeuille de GNL &#58; avec de nouvelles quantités disponibles, sans destination fixe, celui-ci est à même de convaincre des clients essentiels au développement de nos grands projets.</p><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph">Laurent Vivier - Je dirais même que c’est parce qu’elle contribue au développement de nos grands projets que nous avons réalisé cette opération. On touche ici au cœur de la stratégie de Gas &amp; Power &#58; nous mettons à profit nos capacités d’adaptation pour tenir un cap qui sécurise nos positions sur le long terme en dépit des inévitables fluctuations du marché. En cela, l’opération que nous venons de réaliser à Sabine Pass est une réussite indéniable. Elle conforte notre place de n°2 mondial sur l’ensemble de la chaîne du GNL.</p><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph"><em>* début 2010, Total a conclu avec l’américain Chesapeake un accord pour acquérir 25% de son portefeuille dans les Barnett Shale (Texas). Fin 2011, le Groupe a renforcé sa présence dans les gaz non conventionnels américains en prenant une participation de 25 % dans les gisements de gaz de schistes riches en condensats de l’Utica Shale, détenus par Chesapeake et EnerVest.</em></p>]]></WAT:publishingpagecontent><WAT:socialfeature>False</WAT:socialfeature><WAT:source /><WAT:theme /><WAT:userprop /><WAT:username /><WAT:entity /><WAT:nomination /><WAT:upfront>False</WAT:upfront><WAT:global /><WAT:nominationdate /><WAT:keywords /><WAT:publishingrollupimage2>#</WAT:publishingrollupimage2></item><item><title>Livraison de la première cargaison GNL de TGPL à Rudong</title><link>http://wat.corp.local/sites/s106/fr-FR/Pages/2012-2013 Contenus Migrés/Livraison-de-la-première-cargaison-GNL-de-TGPL-à-Rudong.aspx</link><description>Le 11 mars 2013, le Marib Spirit a livré 165 000 m3 de GNL en provenance du Yémen au terminal de  PetroChina à Rudong, en Chine.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2013 11:31:00 +01:00</pubDate><author>Laurent SAUVAGE</author><WAT:subtitle>​Mis en service mi-2011, le terminal de Rudong a reçu 2,8 mt de GNL en 2012</WAT:subtitle><WAT:originalnewspaperlink /><WAT:publishingexpirationdate /><WAT:upfront>False</WAT:upfront><WAT:publishingrollupimage>http://wat-content.corp.local/_layouts/15/total/wat/GetFileHandler.ashx?fileurl=http%3a%2f%2fwat.corp.local%2fsites%2fs106%2ffr-FR%2fPublishingImages%2fPages%2fLivraison-de-la-premi%c3%a8re-cargaison-GNL-de-TGPL-%c3%a0-Rudong%2frudong.png</WAT:publishingrollupimage><WAT:publishingpagecontent><![CDATA[<p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph">​​​Le 11 mars 2013, le Marib Spirit a livré 165 000 m3 de GNL en provenance du Yémen au terminal de &#160;PetroChina à Rudong, en Chine.</p><p class="wat-rteElement-Paragraph"><strong>Sebastien Grieb</strong>, de G&amp;P à Singapour, et <strong>Wu Shu</strong>, de G&amp;P en Chine, étaient sur place pour accueillir la livraison, qui représente la première vente « spot » entre TGPL et PetroChina et ouvre ainsi la voie à une collaboration continue entre PetroChina et Total.

Les visiteurs étaient invités à tester leur conduite sur un simulateur RedBull.<br>&#160;<br>« Nous sommes très satisfaits de cette première et par l’intêret marqué des visiteurs pour Total . Nous avons eu un taux important de fréquentation et des contacts prometteurs .En fait, c’était un des stands les plus fréquentés du salon »&#160; relate avec une pointe de fierté <strong>Christophe </strong><strong>Waechter</strong>, directeur de la filiale. « Nous avons senti que Total Energies Gas était bien perçu par nos consommateurs allemands et que les perspectives s’ouvraient à nous en tant que fournisseur alternatif par rapport aux fournisseurs classiques d’énergie ».<br>&#160;<br>La filiale a été crée en août 2010 et a gagné depuis 1 à 2% du marché B2B allemand. Fort de ce succès, il a été décidé d’étendre ces activités en Belgique et au Pays Bas.</p>]]></WAT:publishingpagecontent><WAT:socialfeature>False</WAT:socialfeature><WAT:source /><WAT:theme /><WAT:userprop /><WAT:username /><WAT:entity /><WAT:nomination /><WAT:upfront>False</WAT:upfront><WAT:global /><WAT:nominationdate /><WAT:keywords /><WAT:publishingrollupimage2>#</WAT:publishingrollupimage2></item><item><title>Forum Gas &amp;
